SINR GeTS: SINR Genetic-based Transmission Scheduler
========================================================

*Status: Alfa -- Version: 0.1*

### What is GeTS?

GeTS introduces a new evolutionary model for solving the SINR scheduling problem. 
A population of individuals (each representing a candidate schedule to solve the 
problem) evolves over generations. To do so, we designed crossover and mutation 
mechanisms that allow the efficient exploration and exploitation of the search 
space. The objective is to find the schedules of minimum size, i.e., with the 
minimum possible number time of slots.<br/> 

### How does it was created?

SINR GeTS was developed using Python 3 programming language, including the 
non-native library NumPy.

### Next Steps

1. CLI interface<br/>
2. Results report generator<br/>
3. GUI interface
